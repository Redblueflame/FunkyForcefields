# Funky Forcefields
Very good ModFest 1.15 mod that adds forcefields to protect your base from enemies! It is very not complete!!!!
It is somewhat unconventional and uses fluids to create forcefields, which are ejected as plasma.

## Blocks
- Fluid Input Hatches take in water/lava/glass/water bucket/lava bucket/rotten flesh from the world and output to Fluid Pipes. They increase the pressure of the fluid in the pipe, allowing you to get enough pressure to start an Ejector.
- Fluid Pipes transfer fluids between blocks. They can be heated by starting a fire directly underneath them.
- Plasma Ejectors turn heated and pressurised fluids into plasma forcefields, which have various behaviours.
- Plasma Projectors were going to be a thing, but I ran out of time. Enjoy the spherical glass forcefield that does nothing!

## Items
- Gauges measure the pressure and temperature of pipes, input hatches and plasma ejectors.

## Fluid Behaviours
- Water becomes steam, which hurts living things but allows items to pass through.
- Lava literally just kills everything.
- Glass is inert, so you can make an unbreakable barrier (or a bridge, when I get round to adding redstone functionality)
- Funky Goo kills mobs but allows players to pass through freely.
